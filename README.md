# My professional portfolio

Hi! My name is Xurxe and this is my second attempt at a professional portfolio. For now I have only used HTML and CSS. Looking forward to improving it as I gain more skills!

I learned a lot and made lots of mistakes in my first attempt (https://github.com/xurxe/portfolio); that's why I decided to completely rebuild it and make this Portfolio 2.0.

## Demo

For now the work in progress can be viewed here: https://xurxe.github.io/portfolio-2.0/  

In the future I will be hosting it in my own domain :)
